            <h2> Being Born Again</h2>
            <p>
                A man named Nicodemus came to Jesus by night. Perhaps he was afraid of criticism or he had a desire for a private conversation, or maybe he wanted to know more before committing himself to Jesus Christ. In any event, he came and asked Jesus some questions.
                <br>
                Jesus looked at him and said, “Nicodemus, you need to be born again” (Cf. John 3:5). In fact, He said, “Verily, verily”—and any time Jesus used that expression, He meant that what was to follow was very important. He said, “Verily, verily, I say unto thee … ye must be born again” (John 3:5,7, KJV).
                <br>
                Have you been born again? Call it conversion, call it commitment, call it repentance, call it being saved, but has it happened to you? Does Christ live in your heart? Do you know it? Many people have thought a long time about religion and Christianity and yet have never made a commitment. Are you committed to Jesus Christ?
                <br>
                Nicodemus must have been stunned when Jesus said, “You must be born again.” It wouldn’t seem shocking if Christ had said that to Zacchaeus the tax collector or to the thief on the cross or to the woman caught in adultery. But Nicodemus was one of the great religious leaders of his time. Still, he was searching for reality.
                <br>
                You may go to church, but perhaps you are still searching. There is an empty place in your heart, and something inside tells you that you’re not really right with God. Nicodemus fasted two days a week. He spent two hours every day in prayer. He tithed. Why did Jesus say that Nicodemus must be born again? Because He could read
                the heart of Nicodemus. Jesus saw that Nicodemus had covered himself with religion but had not yet found fellowship with God.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The New Birth</h3>
            <p>
                Some people ask the question: What is new birth? Nicodemus asked that question too: “How can a man be born when he is old?” He wanted to understand it.
<br><br>
I was born and reared on a dairy farm. How can a black cow eat green grass and produce white milk and yellow butter? I don’t understand that. I might say, “Because I don’t understand it, I’m never going to drink milk again.” And you’d say, “You’re crazy.”
<br><br>
I don’t understand it, but I accept it by faith. Nicodemus could see only the physical and the material, but Jesus was talking about the spiritual.
<br><br>
How is the new birth accomplished? We cannot inherit new birth. The Bible says that those who are born again “were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God” (John 1:13). Our fathers and mothers may be the greatest born-again Christians in the world, but that doesn’t make us born-again Christians, too. Many people have the idea that because they were born into a Christian home, they are automatically Christians. They’re not.
<br><br>
We cannot work our way to God, either. The Bible says that salvation comes “not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:5).
<br><br>
Nor is reformation enough. We can say, “I am going to turn over a new leaf,” or “I am going to make New Year’s resolutions.” But Isaiah said that in the sight of God “all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags” (Isaiah 64:6).
<br><br>
Some of us have changed on the outside to conform to certain social standards or behavior that is expected of us in our churches, but down inside we have never been changed. That is what Jesus was talking to Nicodemus about. He said, “Nicodemus, you need changing inside,” and only the Holy Spirit can do that. Being born from above is a supernatural act of God. The Holy Spirit convicts us of our sin; He disturbs us because we have sinned against God. And then the Holy Spirit regenerates us. That is when we are born again. The Holy Spirit comes to live in our hearts to help us in our daily lives. The Spirit of God gives us assurance, gives us joy, produces fruit in our lives and teaches us the Scriptures.
<br><br>
Some people try to imitate Christ. They think that all we have to do is try to follow Jesus and try to do the things He did, and we will get into heaven. But we can’t do it. We may know the religious songs. We may even say prayers. But if we haven’t been to the foot of the cross, we haven’t been born again. That is the message Jesus is trying to teach us.
<br><br>
To be born again means that “[God] will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you” (Ezekiel 36:26). “Old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17). We are “partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4); we have “passed from death into life” (John 5:24). The new birth brings about a change in our philosophy and manner of living.

            <h3>Steps to becoming a christian</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Believe in God and His Son Jesus Christ.</b> Christians believe God created the heavens and the earth and that He sent down His son Jesus Christ to die for humanity’s sins and grant them forgiveness. This belief is the foundation of any Christian’s faith and is essential to have if you wish to be reborn</li>
                <li><b>Acknowledge your sins and accept Jesus as your Savior.</b> The Bible teaches that all humans have sinned. However, by acknowledging your sins and accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior and Redeemer, you become closer to God and strengthen your faith. To be reborn, recognize how Jesus died for your sins and how, through him, you’ve been made righteous before God. Pray to Jesus and ask him to enter your heart and forgive your sins.</li>
                <li><b>Repent for your sins.</b> Repenting your sins means turning away from sinful behavior and showing regret for the sins you’ve committed. Repent your sins by telling God in prayer that you’re sorry for your actions and are seeking His forgiveness. Remain humble and take time to reflect on why your actions were wrong.</li>
                <li><b>Accept the Holy Spirit into your heart.</b> Those who have been reborn are Christians who have the Holy Spirit living within them. The Holy Spirit lives within their hearts and communicates the beauty of Christ. To get closer to this spiritual rebirth, open your heart and pray to the Holy Spirit. </li>
                <li><b>Join a church to find a religious community.</b> Some Christians believe you don't need to join a church to fully be a Christian, while others believe being a part of a church is essential to declaring your faith. Joining a church can help you learn more about the Bible, connect with other believers, and grow in your faith. It's a good idea to visit a few churches before you pick one to join.</li>
                <li><b>Get baptized by an ordained minister. </b>Baptism is a ceremony of great significance in the Christian church. In being baptized, your sins are forgiven and your path to entering God’s kingdom becomes clearer. You are also reborn as an adopted child of God. While this isn’t necessarily the same thing as being a born-again Christian, it puts you one step closer to being truly born again.</li>
            </ol>
